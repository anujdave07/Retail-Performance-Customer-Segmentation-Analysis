# Retail-Performance-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

End-to-end retail analytics project analyzing transaction data to identify revenue drivers, underperforming categories, and high-value customer segments. Combined Python for data analysis with Power BI for interactive visualization and executive reporting.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Retail leadership needed to understand:
- Which product categories drive revenue vs profit
- Why high-volume categories show low Average Order Value (AOV)
- Which customer segments contribute disproportionately to revenue
- How to optimize category and customer strategies across regions

## 🔍 Analysis Approach

### Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Analyzed retail transaction data across multiple dimensions:
  - Product categories and subcategories
  - Customer demographics (age buckets, gender)
  - Geographic regions
  - Order patterns and pricing

### Key Analyses Performed

**1. Revenue & Profitability Drivers**
- Identified top-performing categories by revenue and gross margin
- Analyzed product mix to understand contribution patterns
- Evaluated price points vs volume to detect optimization opportunities

**2. Order Volume vs AOV Analysis**
- Detected underperforming high-volume categories with low AOV
- Quantified upselling potential across product categories
- Developed recommendations for cross-sell strategies

**3. Customer Cohort Analysis**
- Segmented customers by purchasing behavior and lifetime value
- Identified high-value segments contributing disproportionately to revenue
- Analyzed retention patterns across customer cohorts

## 📈 Key Insights

1. **Premium Customer Impact**: Top 20% of customers contribute 60%+ of total revenue, indicating need for retention-focused strategies

2. **Category Optimization**: High-volume categories (e.g., Accessories) show 30% lower AOV compared to Electronics, presenting clear upselling opportunities

3. **Regional Dispersion**: 40% of revenue concentrated in 3 regions, while 5 regions remain underpenetrated, suggesting expansion potential

4. **Age Demographics**: 25-35 age bracket shows highest CLV but represents only 22% of customer base - growth opportunity

## 💡 Business Recommendations

**Executive Summary delivered to leadership with actionable recommendations:**

- **Category Strategy**: Implement bundling strategies for high-volume, low-AOV categories to increase basket size by estimated 15-20%
- **Customer Strategy**: Launch loyalty program targeting premium segment to improve retention and increase purchase frequency
- **Regional Strategy**: Pilot targeted marketing in underperforming regions with high demographic alignment to premium segments

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data cleaning, transformation, statistical analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **SQL**: Data extraction and aggregation from transaction database
- **MS Excel**: Initial exploratory data analysis and pivot tables
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and executive reporting
